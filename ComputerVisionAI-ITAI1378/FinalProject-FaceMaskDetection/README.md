# Final Project – Face Mask Detection (YOLOv8)

## Overview
A computer vision system that detects whether people are:
- Wearing a mask correctly
- Wearing a mask incorrectly
- Not wearing a mask

## Key Points
- Model: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Dataset: Face Mask Detection dataset (Kaggle, by andrewmvd)
- Tools: Python, Google Colab, PyTorch, Ultralytics, OpenCV

## Files
- `Final_Project_FaceMaskDetection.ipynb` – main project notebook with training, evaluation, and predictions.
- `results/success_1.jpg`, `results/success_2.jpg` – correct detections.
- `results/failure_1.jpg` – example where the model struggled.
