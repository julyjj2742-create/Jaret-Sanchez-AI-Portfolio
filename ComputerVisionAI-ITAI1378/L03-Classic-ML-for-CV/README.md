# L03 – Using Classic Machine Learning in Computer Vision

## Overview
This lab introduced classical machine learning models applied to vision tasks. For this lab, we had two options:
- Option 1: Comprehensive Features Extraction & Algorithm Comparison
- Option 2: Focused Image Classification with SVM
I decided to do both labs to further my understanding of the subject.

## Skills Learned
- Extraction techniques
- ML algorithms
- Experimentation with different kernels and hyperparameters
- Gain a better understanding of performance by comparing and optimizing

## Files
- `L03_A_Classic_ML.ipynb` — include multiple extraction techniques and ML algorithms
- `L03_B_Classic_ML.ipynb` — include a complete image classification system using SVM
