# L04 – Chihuahua or Muffin (Classical ML Classifier)

## Overview
This lab explored the famous “Chihuahua or Muffin” challenge using classical machine learning techniques. The task demonstrates the difficulty of distinguishing visually similar categories without deep learning features.

## Skills Learned
- How to preprocess images for machine learning (resize, grayscale, flatten)
- How to train simple ML models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN
- How to evaluate a classifier using accuracy and confusion matrices
- Understanding why classical ML struggles with complex image problems
