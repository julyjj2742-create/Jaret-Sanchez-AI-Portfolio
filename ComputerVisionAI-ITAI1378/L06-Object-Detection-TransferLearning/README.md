# L06 – Object Detection Using Transfer Learning (Pascal VOC 2007)

## Overview
This lab focused on object detection using transfer learning with a pretrained deep learning model. Instead of training from scratch, we fine-tuned a pretrained detector on the Pascal VOC 2007 dataset to speed up training and improve performance.

## Concepts Covered
- Object detection vs. classification  
- Bounding box annotation formats  
- Transfer learning in computer vision  
- Evaluation metrics

## Skills Learned
- Understanding object detection workflows  
- Training and fine-tuning pretrained models  
- Evaluating model performance  
- Interpreting predictions with bounding boxes  

## Files
- `L06_ObjectDetection.ipynb` — training and evaluation notebook. A lab journal is at the end of the notebook.
