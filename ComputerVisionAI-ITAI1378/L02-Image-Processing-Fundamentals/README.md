# L02 – Image Processing Fundamentals

## Overview
This lab introduced core image processing concepts using OpenCV, including:
- Color spaces (RGB, Grayscale, HSV)
- Filtering and kernels
- Edge detection (e.g., Sobel, Canny)
- Blurring and sharpening
## Contents
- `L02_Image_Processing.ipynb` – main notebook with code, outputs, and explanations.
- `J02_Image_Processing.pdf` – journal
## Skills Learned
- Applying OpenCV functions for basic image operations
- Understanding pixel-level transformations
- Building simple preprocessing pipelines
