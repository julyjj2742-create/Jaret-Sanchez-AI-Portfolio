# L05 – Chihuahua or Muffin (Convolutional Neural Network)

## Overview
This lab revisited the Chihuahua vs. Muffin classification task using a convolutional neural network (CNN). With CNNs, the model is able to extract edges, textures, and shapes automatically, significantly improving accuracy over classical ML methods.

## Skills Learned
- How to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- How convolution, pooling, and dense layers work in image classification
