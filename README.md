### Applied AI Portfolio - Houston Community College

## About Me
I am an Applied AI student at Houston Community College, specializing in computer vision, machine learning, and deep learning. This portfolio showcases my journey 
through the ITAI 1378 - Computer Vision & AI. My labs demonstrate my practical experience building AI systems using OpenCV, classical ML, CNNs, transfer learning, visual-language models, and modern object detection techniques.

## Technical Skills
- Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Computer Vision (OpenCV)
- Natural Language Processing
- Jupyter Notebooks, Google Colab

## Course Projects - ITAI 1378 Computer Vision & AI

### L00 - Colab and Tools Practice Run
Introduction to Google Colab, Python notebooks, and setup for the course.

### L01 - Real-World Applications of Computer Vision
Exploration of how CV is used in healthcare, manufacturing, robotics, and security. I decided to focus on autonomous vehicles.

### L02 - Image Processing Fundamentals
Hands-on experience with filters, kernels, blurring, edge detection, and color models.

### A02 - Image Processing Adventure Quest (Team Project)
Exploring the fundamental concepts of image processing through a creative and interactive "adventure quest."

### L03 - Classic Machine Learning for Computer Vision
Applied SVMs, KNN, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and extraction techniques.

## L04 - Chihuahua or Muffin
Built a classical ML classifier to distinguish dogs from muffins.

## L05 - Chihuahua or Muffin CNN
Improved classification accuracy using a Convolutional Neural Network.

## L06 - Object Detection with Transfer Learning
Fine-tuned a pretrained object detection model using the Pascal VOC dataset.

## L08 - Visual Language Models (VLMs)
Explored image captioning and VL models such as BLIP and CLIP.

## Midterm Project - Proposal
Formal project planning for the Final Computer Vision course.

## Final Project - Face Mask Detection
Object detection model using YOLOv8.
